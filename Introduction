GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

Repository-
A repository is a location where all the files for a particular project are stored. Each project has its own repo, and you can access it
with a unique URL.A repository is usually used to organize a single project. Repositories can contain folders and files, images, videos, 
spreadsheets, and data sets – anything your project needs.
To create a new repository=
1.In the upper right corner, next to your avatar or identicon, click  and then select New repository.
2.Name your repository hello-world.
3.Write a short description.
4.Select Initialize this repository with a README.
5.Click Create repository.

Forking-It is when you create a new project based off of another project that already exists. This is an amazing feature that vastly encourages 
the further development of programs and other projects. If you find a project on GitHub that you’d like to contribute to, you can fork the
repo, make the changes you’d like, and release the revised project as a new repo. If the original repository that you forked to create your
new project gets updated, you can easily add those updates to your current fork.

Pull request-Contributions to a source code repository that uses a distributed version control system are commonly made by means of a pull
request. 

Create a Branch=
1.Branching is the way to work on different versions of a repository at one time.
2.By default your repository has one branch named master which is considered to be the definitive branch. We use branches to experiment and 
make edits before committing them to master.
3.When you create a branch off the master branch, you’re making a copy, or snapshot, of master as it was at that point in time. If someone 
else made changes to the master branch while you were working on your branch, you could pull in those updates.

A new branch called feature (because we’re doing ‘feature work’ on this branch)
